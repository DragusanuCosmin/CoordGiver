# Coordinate Giver
Coordinate Giver is a simple Java GUI application that allows users to obtain the coordinates of their mouse cursor in either pixels or percentages. It provides a transparent window that displays the current cursor position, which updates in real-time as the mouse moves.

# Requirements
Java 8 or higher
How to Use
To use Coordinate Giver, simply run the Main.java file, which will launch the application window. By default, the window will display coordinates in pixels. Click the "Pixels" button to switch to percentage display mode, and click it again to switch back to pixel display mode. To close the application, click the exit button on the top-right corner of the window.
